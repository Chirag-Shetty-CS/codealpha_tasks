# Random Quote Generator

It is a Flutter app that: 
* Displays a random quote every time the user opens the app or clicks a button. 
* Includes a "New Quote" button that shows a different quote on each click. 
* Each quote displays text and author name clearly. 
* And has a clean and minimal UI for better user experience. 


The app uses:
* [zenquotes.io/api/random] to get Quotes with their Authors.
* [HTTP] package to sends request to the API and retrieves the response.
* [convert] package to convert the JSON response into normal string datatype.
* [fluttertoast] package to show my name when the app is opened.
* [flutter_launcher_icons] package to add icon to the app.
